If you are using Python 2.7 or later, I would do it this way:

import collections

infile = open("myfile.txt")
words = collections.Counter()

for line in infile:
    words.update(line.split())
                              
for word, count in words.iteritems():
    print word, count

The collections.Counter class is a dict subclass that is designed exactly for this use case, so there is no need to check for initialization to zero, or so on. Dealing with punctuation as chbrooks suggests is left as an exercise to the reader.
